# Askme2
Askme - question done in objective C

Here is short description of things done :
1. ImageManager : to download image and take care of caching.
2. Cells classes : (View classes)
  OnlyImageCell : Template 1 cell
  CollectionCell :  Template 2 cell
  ScrollViewCell : Template 3 cell
3. HomeController : To display the data present on json (controller class)
4. Items : (model class)
5. CollectionViewCell : To display horizontal cards
6. pods are integrated, but there was no use of it.

Library for horizontal scroller is available via pods. but, i have created it as per design from scratch here.
Upper top bar is not working as we dont have any use case for the same here.
